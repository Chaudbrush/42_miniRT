## Description



### Goal
The goal of your program is to generate images using the Raytracing protocol. Those computer-generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position, defined by simple geometric objects, and each with its own lighting system.



### Overview





## Instructions
To use the program you need to use minilibx, which is a library made by 42 School which abstracts some things from the X11 system, to make it easier for students to get started into graphical programs. There are different versions of minilibx, but the one we are using here works on Ubuntu, can't gurantee it works on every Linux distributions.


### Compilation
To compile, just to do the root of the repository and use `make mlx` (to download the minilibx from the 42 repository) and use `make` after that, to compile all the necessary files.
